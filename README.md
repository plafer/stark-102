# STARK 102

This repository contains an implementation of a STARK, and serves as an accompanying codebase to the excellent [Diving DEEP FRI in the STARK world](https://blog.lambdaclass.com/diving-deep-fri/) blog post by LambdaClass. It is called STARK 102 as it is meant to be a follow-up to Starkware's [STARK 101](https://starkware.co/stark-101/). Ultimately, the goal for this repository is to serve as a stepping stone to understanding and contributing to real world STARK libraries such as [Winterfell](https://github.com/facebook/winterfell).

Please open an issue or start a new Discussion if anything is not clear and requires further explanation. If something is confusing to you, it probably is for many others! We'll gladly use the feedback to improve the documentation.

## Problem statement 

Specifically, we implement a STARK that proves the following statement:

I computed the following sequence:

$$
a_0 = 3\\
a_{n+1} = (a_n)^2 
$$

over the prime field with prime 17. 

Unlike STARK libraries such as [Winterfell](https://github.com/facebook/winterfell), this STARK implementation is completeley hardcoded to this problem.

## Philosophy

This repository builds on STARK 101. Specifically, STARK 101 only shows how the prover works; in STARK 102, we also implement the verifier. STARK 101 also left some nitty-gritty details unexplained, rightly so, to focus on the most important aspects. We try to fill that gap here and explain every little detail, either in this document or in comments in the source code. Also, this implementation is in Rust, the language typically used for production implementations of STARKs.

Similar to STARK 101, this is meant as a resource to learn about STARKs. The goal is not to be efficient; rather, it is to get the whole STARK idea across from start to finish for a simple problem. We agree with LambdaClass that doing a "pen and paper" example of a complex topic is the best way to learn it. Tailoring the implementation to the abovementioned problem allows the reader to easily play around with the code. For example, we hardcode the domain values for the trace (and low-degree extended) polynomials (see `src/domain.rs`). If the reader prints out domain values to inspect the program at runtime, they can refer back to the definition of the domain and *see* their printed value in the source file. We believe this can be helpful in relieving the brain to focus on actually learning STARKs; it certainly was for us.

Where appropriate, we choose the simpler of 2 valid options. For example, we use Lagrange interpolation instead of Fast Fourier Transforms, and FRI instead of DEEP FRI. There are no dependencies other than `blake3` for a hash function, and `anyhow` for convenient errors. We wanted every last detail about what makes STARKs tick to be contained in this repository, whether it's how to compute the logarithm of a field element, how Lagrange interpolation works, or how Merkle tree proof verification actually works. We strongly believe that having everything in one place, where the focus is *ease of understanding* as opposed to efficiency, is very helpful. This is similar in philosophy to STARK 101. Finally, some loops are unrolled, such as when computing FRI layers. This allows us to give a name to each FRI layer, and makes the number of layers explicit. We believe this can help readers identify shortcomings in their understanding. Maybe they expected there to be 4 layers, where in reality there are 3; they probably wouldn't have realized that if we stored the layers as `Vec<FriLayer>`.

## How to approach the repository
`lib.rs` contains the definition of `StarkProof`, the type that defines what a proof looks like. You should first head over to `prover::generate_proof()` to see how a proof is constructed. This will introduce you to all our core types, such as `field::BaseField`, `poly::Polynomial`, `merkle::MerkleTree`, etc.

Then, you can head over to `verifier::verify()` to see how the verifier uses the `StarkProof` struct to accept or reject a proof.

The test at the bottom of `lib.rs` demonstrates the usage of the library. You can also run `cargo doc --open` to generate the docs.

## Discussion
In this section we will discuss important topics in detail. We will focus on the ones that weren't fully explored in STARK 101.

### Commit and Query pattern
If if it is not clear to you why the "commit and query" strategy used in STARKs is a valid way to verify if the prover does indeed have the claimed polynomial, then I recommend you read [this article](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html) by Vitalik. I found it did a great job at conveying the intuition.

### The Channel abstraction
The `Channel`, defined in `src/channel.rs`, is the type that implements the Fiat-Shamir transform. You will find an equivalent type both in STARK 101 and Winterfell. It is a core piece of the STARK implementations.

The Fiat-Shamir transform is a widely used technique to convert an interactive protocol into a non-interactive one. STARKs are defined as an interactive protocol turned non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir transform. I recommend watching the first 7 minutes of [this video](https://youtu.be/9cagVtYstyY?si=85sINdOOvwxhTRio) to get a concise description of the Fiat-Shamir transform.

The `Channel` works in the following way. Creating a `Channel` with `Channel::new()` initializes it with a fixed value (currently the hash of 42). The prover can send messages to the verifier using `Channel::commit()`. Internally, this updates the `Channel`'s state by hashing the prover's message with its current state. Then, a verifier can send messages back (which as mentioned in the video are defined to be uniformly random values in an Interactive Argument) with either `Channel::random_element()` or `Channel::random_integer()`. This works simply by interpreting the `Channel`'s current hash as a field element or an integer, respectively. We then make sure to update the internal hash to a new value so that the `random_*()` methods can be called multiple times and return different values for each call.

The `Channel` is a very clean abstraction to turn an interactive protocol into a non-interactive one. You should now go re-read the implementation of `prover::generate_proof()`, and pay attention to all the calls to `channel.commit()` and `channel.random_element()`/`channel.random_integer()`. In your head, you should now see those as messages being sent back and forth between the prover and the verifier!

Finally, let's turn our attention to how the verifier uses the `Channel` in `verifier::verify()`. First, it must interact with the `Channel` in exactly the same way that the prover did. That way, it ensures to draw the same values from `Channel::random_element()` and `Channel::random_integer()`. This is critical. Notice that the random values (from `random_element/integer()`) are *not* included in the `StarkProof`. Rather, they are re-derived by the verifier. Pause and ponder why this is the only way that the verifier can ensure that the values are indeed random, and that the prover didn't pick convenient values. Think about how the prover could trick the verifier if all "random" values were included in the `StarkProof` as opposed to being rederived by the verifier.

## Exercise to the reader
There's nothing like getting your hands dirty to truly understand something, and hence this exercise. We modify the original statement to:

I computed the following sequence:

$$
a_0 = x            \\
a_{n+1} = (a_n)^2  \\
$$

over the prime field `F_p` with prime 17, for some public `x âˆˆ F_p`.

Essentially, modify the codebase to make the first value in the sequence any value in the set `{0, ..., 16}`. Or in other words, any element of `BaseField`. Notably, this will require you to
+ Change `constraints::boundary_constraint()` to take a parameter `x: BaseField`
    + Hint: you will need to implement polynomial division
+ We can now make `Channel::new()` to take the parameter `x: Basefield`, and initialize the hash using `x` as opposed to `CHANNEL_SALT`.
